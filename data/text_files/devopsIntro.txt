        DevOps is a combination of two words — “Development” and “Operations” — representing a cultural, philosophical, and technical movement that aims to bridge the gap between software development teams (who write the code) and IT operations teams (who deploy and maintain the systems).
        The main goal of DevOps is to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality by fostering collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
        Key Principles:
            -Collaboration and Communication:
            Developers and operations teams work closely together instead of in isolated silos.
            -Automation:
            Repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring are automated to improve speed and reduce human error.
            -Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):
            Code changes are frequently merged, tested, and deployed automatically, ensuring that software is always in a release-ready state.
            -Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
            System infrastructure is managed and provisioned using code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) for consistency and scalability.
            -Monitoring and Feedback:
            Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure provides feedback for faster problem resolution and performance improvement.
